## My Journey
At the age of eight, I got my very first computer during the golden era of Windows XP. I spent countless hours immersed in that world‚Äîplaying CS 1.6 and exploring flash games that, more often than not, were designed simply to wreak havoc. I learned the hard way as viruses in those games repeatedly screwed up my PC. Instead of being discouraged, each reset only fueled my curiosity.

It was during these trials that I stumbled upon the mysterious CMD prompt‚Äîa stark black-on-white window that beckoned exploration. Despite barely knowing English or even my own language well enough, I began mimicking every command I found in assorted .bat files scattered across my system (after, of course, ensuring they weren't malicious). Slowly but surely, I pieced together the help pages and documentation, turning every experiment into a lesson.

By the time I turned 11, I had not only mastered these rudimentary commands but had also embraced hacking and programming as a passion‚Äîa challenge to be conquered rather than a risk to be feared. This journey, full of missteps and hard-won insights, laid the foundation for a lifelong adventure in the world of cybersecurity and technology, one I plan on keep going. My first (and last) ever recorded "lesson" learned from the YouTube itself is a "Matrix" batch script, in late 2015.

Which makes me a proud 10+ years programmer and +/- 10 years digital security breacher guy. 
And yes I barely knew proper grammar then. This changed. (I guess).
